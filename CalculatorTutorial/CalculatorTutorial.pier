!Building a Simple Calculator with Spec


In this chapter we will develop a simple Calculator to get started with Spec. Our focus will be on building the GUI to come up with a simple but goodlooking calculator.
After designing the GUI we will move on to making this hollow interface operational.



!!! Defining the class Specalc


[[[
ComposableModel subclass: #Specalc
	instanceVariableNames: 'faces'
	classVariableNames: ''
	poolDictionaries: ''
	category: 'Dice'
]]]

In the ==initialize== category, define the method ==initialize== as follows. It simply set the default number of faces to 6. 

[[[
Dice>>initialize 
	super initialize.
	faces := 6
]]]


When you execute xxxx you should  see the Figure *figDiceNoDetail*.

!! Conclusion

This chapter illustrates how to use Spec to build applications. A deeper explanation of Spec will be available in a companion chapter.
